# Transcriptome VAE

This project is aimed to test out how to compress transcriptomes into meaningful smaller scale 

## Getting Started

I am working with the transcriptomic data coming from The Cancer Genome Atlas. To get started: download any open TCGA project, the RNA-Seq data for patients of interest. Here I am working with the Breast Cancer data from 2012, as a proof of concept.
